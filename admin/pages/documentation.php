	<div class="page-header"><h3>Updating the plugin</h3><hr class="notop"></div>

	<p>If you installed the Envato Market plugin then updating the Let's Review plugin is very easy. Simply activate the Envato Market plugin, and click on the "Envato Market" menu in WordPress and then connect to their API.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, the other way to update is to:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Download the latest version of the plugin on Codecanyon.</li>
		<li>Go to your Plugins menu in your WordPress site's backend and deactivate the current installed version of Let's Review.</li>
		<li>Delete the plugin.</li>
		<li>Now install the plugin again using the latest lets-review.zip file (see Installation section for full instructions).</li>
	</ol>



	<div class="page-header"><h3>Shortcodes</h3><hr class="notop"></div>

	<p>Let's review comes with a single shortcode with a few options to simplify using it.</p>
	<p>To insert the review box of a post somewhere specific, simply put the following shortcode somewhere in the post content area:</p>

		
	<pre>[letsreview]</pre>


	<p>If you want to add a post review from a different post inside a post, you can use </p>

	<pre>[letsreview postid="123"]</pre>

	<p>And simply replace the 123 value with the id of the post you wish to grab the review from.</p>




	<div class="page-header"><h3>Filters (for developers)</h3><hr class="notop"></div>

		
	<p>If you understand PHP and would like to add your own custom design, you can easily do so by hooking on to the plugin's filters.</p>

	<p>To add a new style/output to the plugin's widget you can easily do it by:</p>

	<p>First let's add the style names you wish to add, by putting this code into your theme's functions.php file:</p>
	 
	<pre>
	function lets_review_custom_widget_style( ) {

		return 'My style name';
	}
	add_filter( 'lets_review_widget_add_design', 'lets_review_custom_widget_style' );</pre>

	<p>And if you want to add multiple designs, simply return an array, like this:</p>

	<pre>
	function lets_review_custom_widget_style( ) {

		return array( 'My style name', 'My second style' );
	}
	add_filter( 'lets_review_widget_add_design', 'lets_review_custom_widget_style' );</pre>

	<p>Now that the styles have been added, you can now write the code you wish is outputted in the widget on your site for your added style(s).</p>

	<p>Add this  code into your theme's functions.php file also:</p>
	<pre>
	function lets_review_widget_style_1_output( ) {

		return '&lt;div&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/div&gt;';
	}
	add_filter( 'lets_review_widget_add_design_html_1', 'lets_review_widget_style_1_output' );</pre>

	<p>The key thing to note is that the filter has a number representing the style. "lets_review_widget_add_design_html_1" finishes with the number "1" in this case would mean the code outputs for the first style added ("My Style Name"). If you have multiple custom styles, you would copy/paste that code for each style and change the number in the filter to the style, so for your second style, you'd use:</p>

	<pre>
	function lets_review_widget_style_2_output( ) {

		return '&lt;div&gt;Hello, Style 2!&lt;/div&gt;';
	}
	add_filter( 'lets_review_widget_add_design_html_2', 'lets_review_widget_style_2_output' );</pre>

	<p>For an example of the html you should be outputting for your custom style, check the widget's PHP file current output for the existing styles as reference.</p>


	<div class="page-header"><h3>Troubleshooting</h3><hr class="notop"></div>

	<p>Common errors:</p>

	<p><strong>Problem #1: Icons aren't showing</strong></p>
	<p>The plugin uses the latest Font Awesome version, if your theme comes with it integrated and is using an older version, the icons may not appear. Simply disable the "Load FontAwesome files" option in the plugin's Extras section in the WordPress menu to use your theme's version.</p>
